Suggestions for improvements:

- better type safeness (e.g. using typescript)
- improve the dependency management (have not worked with node for a while, not sure how to best approach this atm)
- the node_moduls directory is not accessible on the host machine (some docker permissions issue I could not quickly solve)
- add unit tests
- use env file
